                        (CNN) — Almost two decades since Concorde retired, interest around supersonic travel has been
                        picking up pace,
                        and several super-fast planes are under development. Airlines seem interested: United has
                        already committed itself to offering supersonic routes as early as 2029.
                        But what about hypersonic travel, which happens at speeds of Mach 5 -- five times the speed of
                        sound -- and above?
                        That would get an aircraft from New York to London in just 90 minutes, compared to about three
                        hours for Concorde, and between six to seven hours for a regular passenger jet.

                        About 200,000 shipping containers, holding everything from toys and sneakers to critical parts
                        for factories,
                        remain stuck on ships floating off the coast of Los Angeles. A record 100 cargo vessels, from
                        barges to container ships, are anchored outside the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
                        Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg acknowledged Wednesday that despite the Biden
                        administrations efforts to address bottlenecks, it will take time to get supply chains back to
                        normal.
                        "There are going to be disruptions and shocks to the system as long as the pandemic continues,"
                        Buttigieg told CNNs Jim Sciutto.

                        Hellisheiðarvirkjun, Iceland (CNN)The windswept valleys surrounding the Hengill volcano in
                        southwestern Iceland are dotted with hot springs and steam vents.
                        Hikers from all over the world come here to witness its breath-taking scenery. Even the sheep
                        are photogenic in the soft Nordic light.
                        Right in the middle of all that natural beauty sits a towering metal structure resembling four
                        giant Lego bricks, with two rows of six whirring fans running across each one.
                        Its a contraption that looks truly futuristic, like something straight out of a sci-fi film.

                        (CNN)Fossils trapped in amber have been among paleontologys most fascinating finds in recent
                        years -- globs of hardened ancient tree resin have captured tantalizing details about spiders,
                        lizards, microscopic animals, insects, birds and even a tiny dinosaur that are often missing
                        from fossils found in rock.
                        However, all these creatures were land lubbers that you might expect to encounter on a tree
                        trunk or branch. Now, scientists have found the oldest aquatic animal preserved in amber --
                        and its the most complete crab fossil ever discovered.

                        Miss France, the countrys 101-year-old beauty pageant, is being sued by a feminist activist
                        group and three unsuccessful applicants over alleged discriminatory entry requirements.
                        An appeal has been filed against the pageants parent company, Endemol Production, by Osez le
                        féminisme (Dare to be feminist),
                        who in a news statement issued on Tuesday said Miss France contestants perform a work service
                        and therefore should be protected from prejudice under French employment law.
                        Discrimination against employees on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, family situation or
                        genetic characteristics is considered unlawful in France.
                        A 2021 application form for the national beauty pageant revealed candidates would not be
                        considered if they were not at least 5-foot-5, or if they had ever been married or had children.

                        Top executives of major Western oil companies are to testify before the US Congress amid
                        accusations that they misled the public about climate change.
                        Democrat lawmakers say the hearings will focus on the industrys decades-long denial of its
                        products leading role in fuelling climate change.

                        The companies said they hoped to use the hearings to highlight recent efforts to address climate
                        change.

                        This comes just days before the start of the UNs COP26 climate conference.

                        The Glasgow meeting is seen as a crucial part of efforts to avoid runaway climate change. World
                        leaders will be pressed on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce global
                        warming.
