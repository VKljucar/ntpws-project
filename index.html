                    The term HTML5 is essentially a buzzword that refers to a set of modern web technologies. This includes the HTML Living Standard, along with JavaScript APIs to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.
                    You may sometimes hear about "new HTML5 elements", or find HTML5 described as a new version of HTML. 
                    HTML5 was the successor to previous HTML versions and introduced new elements and capabilities to the language on top of the previous version, HTML 4.01, as well as improving or removing some existing functionality. 
                    However, as a Living Standard HTML now has no version. The up-to-date specification can be found at html.spec.whatwg.org/.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
                    CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
                    CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. 
                    Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. 
                    You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.
