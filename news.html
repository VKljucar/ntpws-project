                    (CNN) — Almost two decades since Concorde retired, interest around supersonic travel has been picking up pace, 
                    and several super-fast planes are under development. Airlines seem interested: United has already committed itself to offering supersonic routes as early as 2029.
                    But what about hypersonic travel, which happens at speeds of Mach 5 -- five times the speed of sound -- and above? 
                    That would get an aircraft from New York to London in just 90 minutes, compared to about three hours for Concorde, and between six to seven hours for a regular passenger jet.

                    About 200,000 shipping containers, holding everything from toys and sneakers to critical parts for factories, 
                    remain stuck on ships floating off the coast of Los Angeles. A record 100 cargo vessels, from barges to container ships, are anchored outside the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
                    Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg acknowledged Wednesday that despite the Biden administration's efforts to address bottlenecks, it will take time to get supply chains back to normal.
                    "There are going to be disruptions and shocks to the system as long as the pandemic continues," Buttigieg told CNN's Jim Sciutto.

                    Hellisheiðarvirkjun, Iceland (CNN)The windswept valleys surrounding the Hengill volcano in southwestern Iceland are dotted with hot springs and steam vents.
                    Hikers from all over the world come here to witness its breath-taking scenery. Even the sheep are photogenic in the soft Nordic light.
                    Right in the middle of all that natural beauty sits a towering metal structure resembling four giant Lego bricks, with two rows of six whirring fans running across each one. 
                    It's a contraption that looks truly futuristic, like something straight out of a sci-fi film.

                    (CNN)Fossils trapped in amber have been among paleontology's most fascinating finds in recent years -- globs of hardened ancient tree resin have captured tantalizing details about spiders, 
                    lizards, microscopic animals, insects, birds and even a tiny dinosaur that are often missing from fossils found in rock.
                    However, all these creatures were land lubbers that you might expect to encounter on a tree trunk or branch. Now, scientists have found the oldest aquatic animal preserved in amber -- 
                    and it's the most complete crab fossil ever discovered.

                    iss France, the country's 101-year-old beauty pageant, is being sued by a feminist activist group and three unsuccessful applicants over alleged discriminatory entry requirements.
                    An appeal has been filed against the pageant's parent company, Endemol Production, by Osez le féminisme (Dare to be feminist), 
                    who in a news statement issued on Tuesday said Miss France contestants perform a work service and therefore should be protected from prejudice under French employment law.
                    Discrimination against employees on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, family situation or genetic characteristics is considered unlawful in France. 
                    A 2021 application form for the national beauty pageant revealed candidates would not be considered if they were not at least 5-foot-5, or if they had ever been married or had children.
